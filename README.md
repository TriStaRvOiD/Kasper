* The app uses Android's step detection sensor
* The Room library acts as a local database for storing the user's steps along with the corresponding date.
* Weather information is fetched through Retrofit

## Contributions
I am anything but a seasoned developer, and my coding skills are not spectacular at the moment; so, contributions are truly appreciated.
